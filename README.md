# News App

Welcome to the News App! This is a simple mobile application built with **Flutter** that allows users to browse the latest news articles from various sources. The app is designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to navigate.

## Features

- **Browse Latest News**: Users can explore the latest news articles from multiple sources.
- **Search Articles**: Search for articles by keywords, categories, or sources.
- **Article Details**: View the full details of each article including the title, description, and publication date.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: The mobile framework used for building the app.
- **Dart**: The programming language used to develop the app.
- **News API**: To fetch the latest news articles (replace with your actual API if used).
- **Bloc**: For state management.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed on your machine.
- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) (if not included with Flutter SDK).
- An IDE like **VSCode** or **Android Studio** for running and testing the app.
